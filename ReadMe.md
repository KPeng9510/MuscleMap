## MuscleMap: Towards Video-based Activated Muscle Group Estimation

In this paper, we tackle the new task of video-based Activated Muscle Group Estimation (AMGE) aiming at identifying currently activated  muscular regions of humans performing a specific activity. Video-based AMGE is an important yet overlooked problem. To this intent, we provide the MuscleMap136 featuring >15K video clips with 136 different activities and 20 labeled muscle groups. This dataset opens the vistas to multiple video-based applications in sports and rehabilitation medicine. We further complement the main MuscleMap136 dataset, which specifically targets physical exercise, with Muscle-UCF90 and Muscle-HMDB41, which are new variants of the well-known activity recognition benchmarks extended with AMGE annotations. With MuscleMap136, we discover limitations of state-of-the-art architectures for human activity recognition when dealing with multi-label muscle annotations and good generalization to unseen activities is required.
To address this, we propose a new multimodal transformer-based model, \textsc{TransM$^3$E}, which surpasses current activity recognition models for AMGE, especially as it comes to dealing with previously unseen activities.
